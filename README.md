# Customer Churn Prediction in Telecommunications

## Project Overview
This project, undertaken as part of Machine Learning Coursework in final year DSBA, focuses on predict and understand customer churn patterns using dominant determinants within a fictional telecommunication company, Telco. By leveraging different predictive modelling, we aim to develop a robust solution that can foresee potential customer departures. 

## Business Challenge
Customer churn directly impacts revenue and growth in the telecom sector. This project aims to understand and predict churn, thereby enabling more informed and strategic decision-making for customer retention. Our study can facilitate the construction of an effective prediction tool for managers in the telecom sector to discover the underlying churn-risk customers which have a high probability of transferring to their competitors. Under such circumstances, the managers can take favourable measures to re-attract those underlying churners by promoting the dominant determinants revealed by this study through ML feature selection techniques.

## Methodology
We used exploratory data analysis to understand churn patterns, followed by the application of various machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, logistic regression, SVM, XGBoost, and ANN. The models were evaluated based on their accuracy and effectiveness in predicting churn.

## Results
The study revealed logistic regression, SVM (with hyperparameter tuning), and ANN (with hyperparameter tuning) as the most effective in churn prediction. This analysis offers a pragmatic approach for telecommunication companies to tailor their retention strategies.
